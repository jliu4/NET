NOTES
-----
The files can be input-specified to account for proprietary data
    but must have a specific form per the manual

The sequence is important because it must correspond with the ICHAR
    value given in the file 'RISPRE.IN'.  For example, ICHAR=4 means to
    use the fourth file above, 'out3.in'

The list above gives the "standard hydrodynamic database for VIVA":
    ICHAR=1 for 'basic_bare' is for a bare cylinder
    ICHAR=2 for 'out1.in' is for a VETCO-section at 0 deg
    ICHAR=3 for 'out2.in' is for a VETCO-section at 30 deg
    ICHAR=4 for 'out3.in' is for a VETCO-section at 60 deg
    ICHAR=5 for 'out4.in' is for a VETCO-section at 90 deg
    ICHAR=6 for 'out5.in' is for a VETCO-section at 120 deg
    ICHAR=7 for 'out6.in' is for a VETCO-section at 150 deg
    ICHAR=8 for 'out7.in' is for a staggered buoyancy-bare configuration
    ICHAR=9 for 'out_hr.in' is for high-RE data
    ICHAR=10 for 'out1.in' is for a straked cylinder
